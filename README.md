# PyBer_Analysis
## 1. Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to compare and contrast the data by city type (rural, suburban, and urban). I looked at total rides, total drivers, and total fares by city type. Then, I calculated average fare per ride and average fare per driver and created a DataFrame from this information. Lastly, in order to visualize this data more clearly, I made a line chart that displayed the total weekly fares for each type of city. 
## 2. Results

Based on the Pyber Summary DataFrame, it is clear that urban cities altogether have significantly more rides, drivers, and total fares than even both rural and suburban cities combined.
