# PyBer_Analysis
## 1. Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to compare and contrast the data by city type (rural, suburban, and urban). I looked at total rides, total drivers, and total fares by city type. Then, I calculated average fare per ride and average fare per driver and created a DataFrame from this information. Lastly, in order to visualize this data more clearly, I made a line chart that displayed the total weekly fares for each type of city.

Based on the Pyber Summary DataFrame, it is clear that urban cities altogether have significantly more rides, drivers, and total fares than even both rural and suburban cities combined. While urban cities may have more rides and drivers, they have a much lower average fare per ride. Rural cities on average charge $10 more per ride than urban cities. Also, since there are a lot less rural drivers, the average fare per driver is higher. In other words, rural and suburban drivers make more money than urban drivers, since there are less of them.

Now, looking at the Total Fare by City Type chart, the months January through April in 2019 show similarly what the DataFrame above does. Urban cities consistently have the highest total fares, while suburban is in second and rural cities have the lowest. A noticeable trend for all the city types is a spike in fares towards the end of February. Even though the fares for each city type are very differnt, they all tend to follow a similar pattern in spikes and falls in total fares.
